Creating a DB:

Step 1: Gathering information on the DB's Business rules.

Step 2: Build an ERD based off of the business rules.

Step 3: Perform normalization

Step 4: Build the Database (either through GUI or through SQL code)

Step 5: Put in some Data

Step 6: Ask simple questions of the Data

======================================================================

Front End Developement: HTML/CSS/JAVASCRIPT Coding an user interface.

Back End Developement: PYTHON/ASP/JSP/PHP/ColdFusion/CGI/PERL/JS Embeded SQL code.

Why a Dotted line instead of a Solid line in ERD?  Dotted == Weak link, Solid == Strong Link, Solids have the same primary key in both, Dotted has two different primary keys and one accepts the others key as a fake key

Weak Entity: Depends on existance of another entity, and has a primary key derived from the parent entity
