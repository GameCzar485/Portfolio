SQL == Structured Query Language (Became standard in 1980s)

Microsoft introduced SQL server in 1990s

MetaData = Data about data (not the phone call, but the time it occured and for how long)

My SQL -- open source but not as good as SQL server or Oracle (now owned by Oracle)

Polyglot -- an organization is not relying on only one database

NoSQL -- Made in 2000s  (google,facebook)  (First was BigTable)   (Doesn't require schema)

Flat Files - contain records but provide no information about file structure or relationships.

Hierarchical Database - Built with parent/child relationships
