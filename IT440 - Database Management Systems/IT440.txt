=====================
A. Describe the role of database design as the foundation of a successful information system?

	It is the process that determines the database structure and components which is the second phase of the \n
	database lifecycle.

B. Describe the five phases in the systems development life cycle.
	
	1.Planning involves the initial assessment and feasability study.
	2.Analysis is the phase where you evaluate current systems, create a logical design, and find out user requirements
	3.Detailed Systems Design
	4.Implementation, coding, testing, debugging, installation, and fine-tuning.
	5.Maintenance, evaluating, and enhancing.

C. Design databases using the six phases in the Database Life Cycle framework.

	1.Database initial study, Analyze the situation, define problems, constraints, objectives, as well as scope.
	2.Database design, create concept design, select DBMS software, create the logical and physical design.
	3.Implementation and loading, install the DBMS create the database, import data.
	4.Testing and Evaluation, test and fine-tune the database, ecaluate.
	5.Operation, Produce the required information flow.
	6.Maintenance and evolution, Introduce changes, and make enhancements.

D. Conduct evaluation and revision within the SDLC and DBLC frameworks.

E. Distinguish between top-down and bottom-up approaches in database design
	
	Top-down: define the main structures first and then define the smaller details within.
	Bottom-up: define the smaller systems first and then intengrate them into a larger main system.

F. Distinguish between centralized and decentralized conceptual database design.

	Centralized design: A process by which all database design decisions are carried out by a central group of people. \n
	(a unit or department of an organization)
	Decentralized design: A Process in which conceptual design models subsets of an organization's database requirements \n
	, which are then aggregated into a complete design.
